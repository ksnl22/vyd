    <h1 style="color: rgb(41, 39, 39);">Sankranti, also known as Makar Sankranti, is a major harvest festival celebrated across India, marking the Sunâ€™s transition into the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara Rashi) and the beginning of its northward journey, known as Uttarayan. This festival signifies the end of winter and the arrival of longer, warmer days, which is a crucial period for farmers as it signals the start of the harvest season and the ripening of winter crops. The celebration is deeply rooted in gratitude towards nature and the Sun God, Surya, for a bountiful harvest and prosperity. Rituals such as taking a holy dip in rivers, offering prayers, and acts of charity like donating sesame seeds, jaggery, grains, and clothes to the needy are considered sacred and bring good karma</h1>
